Forensics experts collect data from crime scenes and use mathematics to help solve some unanswered questions about the crime.  One of the physical tools they use are calipers to measure the length and width of blood drops or hair follicles.  To determine angles of impact they use the law of sine and even the law of tangents to calculate the height of the source. 
Create a program that will allow investigators to type in their measurement findings and output answers to help in their investigation.
 
Create a project named Forensics with two major functions getHairType and getHeight.  Be sure to use at least four variables, medullaDiameter, entireHair, femurHeight, and gender.  (50 pts)
 
Hair Type
The program should have a function named getHairType that receives two parameters, medulla diameter and entire hair diameter.  The function should calculate the ratio of the diameter of the medulla to the diameter of the entire hair.  Use millimeters as the unit of measure.  Animal hair exhibits ratio of .5 or higher.  A ratio less than .5 is considered human hair.  The program should return a 1 for human hair and a 0 for animal hair.  (20 pts)

Human Height
The program should also have a function named getHeight.  Scientists measure the human body using proportions.  In a crime scene investigation, a person's height can be estimated using the femur.  A formula is used depending on the gender of the person. 
Male:  height = 69.089 + 2.238f (f stands for the femur length in cm)
Female: height = 61.412 + 2.317f  (f stands for the femur length in cm)
The function receives the gender as an integer 0 for Male and 1 for Female and the length of a femur in centimeters.  The function should return the height of the victim in centimeters. (20 pts)

Validate your inputs.
The program should keep the user experience in mind.
Add comments to each line of code.
